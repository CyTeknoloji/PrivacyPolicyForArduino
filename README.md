Privacy Policy for Arduino IDE: Projects and AI
Last Updated: May 24, 2024 (Or current date)

This Privacy Policy describes how Cy Tech ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile applications available on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. By installing and using our applications, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.

1. Information Collection and Use
A. Personal Information
To provide certain features (such as user accounts, cloud sync, or AI-powered analysis), we may ask for:

Account Information: Email address, username, and profile picture (via Google Sign-In or manual registration).

Stored Data: User-generated code or project notes are stored on encrypted servers and are not shared with third parties.

B. Hardware and System Permissions
To function as a professional Arduino/IoT tool, the app requires the following permissions:

Camera & Gallery: Used for AI-based circuit analysis, image-to-code features, and profile picture updates.

USB (Host Mode): Necessary to communicate with, program, and monitor Arduino/ESP boards directly from your mobile device.

Microphone: Used only when specific voice-command or audio-reactive project features are activated by the user.

Bluetooth & Location: Required for scanning and connecting to Bluetooth-enabled hardware (HC-05, ESP32, etc.). Location data is required by Android system standards for Bluetooth scanning and is not tracked by us.

Storage (Read/Write): Used to save or load your .ino sketches and project files locally.

2. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Features
Our app utilizes advanced AI models (such as Google Gemini or OpenAI) to analyze circuit images and generate code.

Data Processing: When you use AI features, images or text prompts may be sent to third-party AI providers for processing. This data is handled according to the respective provider's privacy standards and is not used to identify you personally.

3. Monetization and Third-Party Links
A. Advertising
We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. These services may use the Advertising ID (AD_ID) to show personalized ads. You can manage these settings in your device's privacy menu.

B. Affiliate Marketing Disclosure
The app contains affiliate links to third-party platforms like AliExpress and Amazon.

Transparency: If you click on these links and purchase hardware components, we may receive a small commission at no extra cost to you.

Liability: We are not responsible for the content, quality, or delivery of products purchased through third-party links.

C. In-App Purchases
We use Google Play Billing for premium features (e.g., ad removal). All payment transactions are handled securely by Google; we do not store your credit card or billing information.

4. Data Security and Third-Party Services
We take industry-standard measures to protect your data. However, no digital environment is 100% secure. We utilize trusted third-party services for app functionality:

Firebase: For database and authentication.

AdMob: For advertising.

Google Play Services: For core app functionality and USB/Bluetooth management.

5. Disclaimer of Liability
Our content is provided "as-is" for educational and hobbyist purposes. While we strive for accuracy, Cy Tech is not responsible for hardware damage, data loss, or any negative outcomes resulting from the use of our codes, simulations, or AI-generated suggestions.

6. User Rights and Deletion
You have the right to access, update, or delete your account information at any time within the app settings. For complete data deletion requests, please contact us at the email provided below.
